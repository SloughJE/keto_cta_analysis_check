## Linear Model Assumptions 


::: {.smaller}


4 Simple Linear Regression Assumptions

3 are tested with data

::: {.fragment}

- **Linearity**: between the predictor and the outcome

- **Constant variance** (homoscedasticity) of residuals

- **Normally distributed residuals** 

:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}

These linear assumptions are **quantifiable** and **objectively testable**.

:::
::: {.fragment}

- If the assumptions don’t hold, statistical significance and uncertainty estimates aren’t trustworthy
- Results may be invalid

:::
:::

::: {.notes}

- Linearity: on average, the relationship between the predictor and the outcome is a straight line

If the true pattern is curved, the slope summarizes the wrong thing and can misstate direction and size.

- Independence of errors

Dependence makes uncertainty estimates too small or too large.

- Constant variance (homoskedasticity)

If the spread grows or shrinks, standard errors and p-values from the basic model are mis-calibrated.

- Normally Distributed Residuals (errors) (mainly for small samples): error terms follow normal distribution.

The usual t-tests and confidence intervals rely on this; strong departures undermine those calculations.


- No exact collinearity (relevant in multivariable settings): predictors aren’t exact copies of each other.

### Response from Authors

> ["The validity of the regression models is also questionable. Despite claims of meeting assumptions, variables were reported using medians, suggesting non-normal distributions.

### Subjective Assumptions


::: {.smaller}


- Calling residual plot evaluation "subjective" is **misleading.**

::: {.fragment}

- Visual checks are interpretive, but these linear assumptions are **quantifiable** and **objectively testable**.

:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}

- "reran all models with robust linear regression...`MASS::rlm`"
:::
::: {.fragment}

- Robust Linear Regression mainly just down-weights outliers.

:::
::: {.fragment}

- Does not deal with non-linearity, heteroskedasticity and non-normality of residuals.

:::

:::

::: {.notes}

RLM can sometimes help a bit with non-normality but depends.

The two violations, non-normality and heteroskedasticity, are largely driven by the outcome’s distribution (ΔNCPV) and its mean–variance pattern. Swapping predictors (e.g., APOB vs CAC) usually won’t fix those. So it’s likely most univariable Δ models would show the same two problems.

### No TPS Model Results

::: {.smaller_table}

> "**Results** Neither change in ApoB ..., baseline ApoB, nor total LDL-C exposure ... were associated with the change in noncalcified plaque volume (NCPV) or TPS."

> "Neither … change in ApoB nor the ApoB level ... were associated ... with **TPS** (Figures 2D and 2E, **Table 3**)." - "changes in and baseline levels of ApoB were not associated with changes in NCPV or TPS"

<br>

:::

::: {.smaller2}

::: {.fragment}

Figures 2D–2F are Δ-TPS (outcome) panels (vs ΔApoB, ApoB, CAC_bl)

:::

<br>

Table 3 has no Δ-TPS models

No Δ-TPS ~ LDL-C exposure models or results anywhere.

### Lifetime LDL-C Exposure Calculation

::: {.smaller_table}

> "LDL-C exposure on a KD was calculated by summing the products of the reported days on a KD prior to study commencement and baseline LDL-C on a KD plus the study follow-up days by their final LDL-C."



$$
\text{LDL-C}_{\text{exp}}
=
Days_{\text{KD}}\cdot LDL_{\text{baseline}}
\;+\;
Days_{\text{follow-up}}\cdot LDL_{\text{final}}
$$

<br>

:::
::: {.smaller2}

::: {.fragment}

- one baseline value for all pre-study KD time and one final value for all follow-up is a coarse simplification
- relies on recall of KD start
:::
::: {.fragment}
- standard AUC/time-weighted approach (need multiple measurements)
- limitation due to resources

:::
:::

---

### Lifetime LDL-C Exposure Calculation

::: {.smaller_table}

> "LDL-C exposure on a KD was calculated by summing the products of the reported days on a KD prior to study commencement and baseline LDL-C on a KD plus the study follow-up days by their final LDL-C."



$$
\text{LDL-C}_{\text{exp}}
=
Days_{\text{KD}}\cdot LDL_{\text{baseline}}
\;+\;
Days_{\text{follow-up}}\cdot LDL_{\text{final}}
$$


> "Estimated lifelong LDL-C additionally included the product of age upon commencing a KD and pre-KD LDL-C."


$$
\text{Life-LDL-C}_{\text{exp}}
=
Days_{\text{KD}}\cdot LDL_{\text{baseline}}
\;+\;
Days_{\text{follow-up}}\cdot LDL_{\text{final}}
\;+\;
\boldsymbol{\big( Age_{\text{at-KD-start}}\cdot LDL_{\text{pre-KD}} \big)}
$$

::: {.fragment}

- **This equation is nonsensical. It is invalid.**

:::
::: {.fragment}
- It adds days and age together. It's like adding miles and inches.
- pre-KD term is down-scaled by ~365× relative to the day-based terms.
- any associations with outcomes are dominated by keto diet exposure.
- if they did convert age, "lifetime" exposure just reflects how old someone was at KD

### Age "mediation" analysis


![](assets/Age_mediation_bp.png){style="width:60%; height:auto !important;"}

::: {.smaller_caption}

> "Estimated lifetime LDL-C exposure was only a significant predictor of final NCPV in the univariable analysis but lost significance when age was included as a covariate (Table 3). Both age and lifetime LDL-C exposure lost significance when baseline CAC was included in the model (Table 3)."

:::

::: {.smaller_table}

A mediation analysis:

::: {.fragment}

- tests how an exposure affects an outcome through a middle step (the *mediator*)
- estimates an indirect effect (through the mediator) and a direct effect (everything else).
- requires a pre-specified pathway and proper statistical testing (usually with CIs or bootstraps).

::: {.fragment}

**This is not a mediation analysis**.

- No indirect effect was estimated or tested.
- Age can’t be a mediator of LDL exposure (age isn’t caused by LDL); it’s a confounder.
- They only compared p-values after adding variables.

:::
:::
:::

::: {.notes}


Exposure (E): lifetime LDL-C exposure
Mediator (M): baseline CAC (CAC_bl)
Outcome (Y): final NCPV
Confounder (A): age (affects E, M, and Y)

- The mediated/indirect path you’d test is: E → M → Y (LDL exposure → baseline CAC → final NCPV).
- When you include M = baseline CAC in the model, you block that E → M → Y path and estimate only the direct effect of E on Y (the E → Y arrow not going through M).

So “Adding baseline CAC blocks the pathway → tests only the direct effect” means: conditioning on baseline CAC removes the indirect route through CAC, leaving only the unmediated E → Y association to be estimated.


What mediation is (A → C through B):

Specify roles: Exposure (A), Mediator (B), Outcome (C).

Fit two models:

B ~ A (+ confounders) → path a

C ~ A + B (+ confounders) → paths b, c′

Report the indirect effect (a×b) with CIs (usually bootstrapped). State assumptions.

Only shows outcome regressions (NCPV_final ~ Age, then + Life-LDL-C_exp, then + CAC_bl).

No mediator model, no indirect effect, no CIs.

The “mediator” (Life-LDL-C_exp) is partly built from Age and mixes units → mathematical coupling; any drop in the Age coefficient can be mechanical.

### Age "mediation" analysis


![](assets/Age_mediation_bp.png){style="width:60%; height:auto !important;"}

::: {.smaller_caption}

> "Estimated lifetime LDL-C exposure was only a significant predictor of final NCPV in the univariable analysis but lost significance when age was included as a covariate (Table 3). Both age and lifetime LDL-C exposure lost significance when baseline CAC was included in the model (Table 3)."

:::

::: {.smaller_table}

They ran (reported) three regressions in sequence.

::: {.fragment}

Conclusion: after adjusting for baseline CAC, neither age nor lifetime LDL-C predicts NCPV_final.

:::
::: {.fragment}

- CAC explains the association; age / lifetime LDL-exposure don’t matter.

:::
::: {.fragment}

Changes in p-values come from collinearity due to Age being embedded in lifetime LDL-C exposure.

Age is a confounder/proxy for exposure duration, not a mediator.

<br> 

:::
::: {.fragment}

**They did NOT report `NCPV_final ~ lifetime LDL-C exposure` model results.**

:::
:::

::: {.notes}

they actually did a stepwise covariate adjustment on highly collinear variables and then over-interpreted p-value changes.

“loss of significance” doesn’t show that LDL or Age don’t matter; it shows the model is not set up to answer the mediation/mechanism question.


Intended pathway?: lifetime LDL-C → baseline CAC → NCPV_final.

Age affects all variables.


The “mediator” (Life-LDL-C_exp) is partly built from Age and mixes units → mathematical coupling; any drop in the Age coefficient can be mechanical.

### Bayes Factor R-scale

::: {.smaller_table}

> "Bayes factors were calculated...with default settings and an `~ rscale value of 0.8` to contrast a moderately informative prior with a conservative distribution width (to allow for potential large effect sizes) due to the well-documented association between ApoB changes and coronary plaque changes."

:::

::: {.smaller2}

::: {.fragment}

Calling 0.8 "moderately informative" is inaccurate.

:::
::: {.fragment}

[R package docs](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/BayesFactor/html/regressionBF.html): **"medium", "wide", "ultrawide" = 0.354, 0.5, 0.707**  

:::
::: {.fragment}

- `rscaleCont = 0.8` is **wider than “ultrawide”** → a **very diffuse** prior that places substantial mass on **very large** effects  
- No reported **prior-sensitivity** to alternative r-scales  
- Same r-scale apparently used for **all models**, no justification.

:::
:::

::: {.smaller_table}
::: {.fragment}

**Fixed description**:
:::

::: {.fragment}

"We used a very wide prior on coefficients (`rscale = 0.8`, wider than the package’s "ultrawide"), which places substantial prior mass on very large effects. This diffuse prior penalizes small-to-moderate effects, requiring substantially stronger evidence than under the ‘wide’ or ‘medium’ defaults to support them."

### Conclusions from Univariable Δ-Models

::: {.smaller_table}

> "Linear models on the primary (NCPV) and secondary outcomes were univariable"

:::

::: {.smaller2}

::: {.fragment}

All conclusions based on independent univariable change score models

`Δ-NCPV ~ ApoB`; `Δ-NCPV ~ NCPV_baseline`

:::
::: {.fragment}

- Confounding unchecked (age, sex, BP, CAC_bl, baseline plaque) 
- Δ-NCPV contains baseline NCPV, biasing associations (mathematical coupling)
- less power, more noise
- ignores starting plaque and basics like age/sex/blood
- baseline imbalance and shared correlates can inflate, reduce, or reverse associations


:::
::: {.fragment}

Consensus in [biostatistics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.2682): use [ANCOVA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16526009/) [style model](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1121605), [follow-up](https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc9557845) ~ baseline + covariates for pre/post analyses.

`NCPV_follow-up ~ NCPV_baseline + ApoB_baseline + age + sex + systolic_BP`

:::
:::

---

### Conclusions from Univariable Δ-Models

::: {.smaller2}

`ΔNCPV ~ ApoB_baseline` (unadjusted change score)

:::

::: {.smaller_table}

::: {.fragment}

**Question**: "Among all participants, is baseline ApoB associated with the raw change in plaque over 1 year, without accounting for where people started or other factors"?

:::
::: {.fragment}

**Slope interpretation**: Average difference in change (mm³) per 1 mg/dL higher ApoB, unadjusted.

:::
::: {.fragment}

**Clinically limited**: Doesn’t condition on starting plaque, age, sex, BP; easily distorted by baseline differences and extra noise in change scores.<br> 
It doesn’t tell an individual with given baseline/risk profile what their 1-year plaque will be.

:::

:::

::: {.smaller2}

::: {.fragment}

`NCPV_follow-up ~ NCPV_baseline + ApoB_baseline + age + sex + systolic_BP` (ANCOVA)

:::

:::

::: {.smaller_table}

::: {.fragment}

**Question**: Among people with the same starting plaque, age, sex, and BP, do those with higher ApoB tend to have more plaque at 1 year?

:::
::: {.fragment}

**Slope interpretation**: Expected difference in 1-year NCPV (mm³) per 1 mg/dL higher ApoB, holding baseline NCPV and covariates fixed.

:::
::: {.fragment}

**Clinically relevant**: Aligns with what a patient asks: “Given where I start and my risk factors, does higher ApoB mean more plaque next year, and by how much?” 

:::

::: {.fragment}

Optionally test ApoB × NCPV_baseline to allow baseline-dependent progression.
