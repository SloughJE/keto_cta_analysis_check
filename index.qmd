## Linear Model Assumptions 


::: {.smaller}


4 Simple Linear Regression Assumptions

3 are tested with data (in this situation)

::: {.fragment}

- **Linearity**: between the predictor and the outcome

- **Constant variance** (homoscedasticity) of residuals

- **Normally distributed residuals** 

:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}

These linear assumptions are **quantifiable** and **objectively testable**.

:::
::: {.fragment}

- If the assumptions don’t hold, statistical significance and uncertainty estimates aren’t trustworthy
- Results may be invalid

:::
:::

::: {.notes}

- Linearity: on average, the relationship between the predictor and the outcome is a straight line

If the true pattern is curved, the slope summarizes the wrong thing and can misstate direction and size.

- Independence of errors (can be tested in some situations, not this one)

Dependence makes uncertainty estimates too small or too large.

- Constant variance (homoskedasticity)

If the spread grows or shrinks, standard errors and p-values from the basic model are mis-calibrated.

- Normally Distributed Residuals (errors) (mainly for small samples): error terms follow normal distribution.

The usual t-tests and confidence intervals rely on this; strong departures undermine those calculations.


- No exact collinearity (relevant in multivariable settings): predictors aren’t exact copies of each other.

Calling residual plot evaluation "subjective" is evasive.
Visual checks are interpretive, but these assumptions **objectively** testable with **quantifiable** methods.

Robust Linear Regression mainly down-weights outliers

It does not deal with non-linearity, heteroskedasticity and non-normality of residuals (directly, it can help sometimes...but)

- This is Statistics 101.

:::

:::

::: {.notes}

RLM can sometimes help a bit with non-normality but depends.

The two violations, non-normality and heteroskedasticity, are largely driven by the outcome’s distribution (ΔNCPV) and its mean–variance pattern. Swapping predictors (e.g., APOB vs CAC) usually won’t fix those. So it’s likely most univariable Δ models would show the same two problems.

### Bayes Factor `rscale` is not Moderate

> "Bayes factors were calculated...with...an ~ `rscale value of 0.8` to contrast a **moderately informative** prior with a conservative distribution width (to allow for potential large effect sizes) due to the well-documented association between ApoB changes and coronary plaque changes."

:::

:::{.incremental}

### LDL-C Exposure Calculation

::: {.smaller_table}

> "LDL-C exposure on a KD was calculated by summing the products of the reported days on a KD prior to study commencement and baseline LDL-C on a KD plus the study follow-up days by their final LDL-C."



$$
\text{LDL-C}_{\text{exp}}
=
Days_{\text{KD}}\cdot LDL_{\text{baseline}}
\;+\;
Days_{\text{follow-up}}\cdot LDL_{\text{final}}
$$

<br>

:::
::: {.smaller2}

::: {.fragment}

- one baseline value for all pre-study Keto Diet time and one final value for all follow-up is a coarse simplification
- relies on recall of KD start
:::
::: {.fragment}
- standard AUC/time-weighted approach (need multiple measurements)
- limitation due to resources

:::

### Lifetime LDL-C Formula Doesn’t Add Up

::: {.smaller_table}

> "LDL-C exposure on a KD was calculated by summing the products of the reported days on a KD prior to study commencement and baseline LDL-C on a KD plus the study follow-up days by their final LDL-C."



$$
\text{LDL-C}_{\text{exp}}
=
Days_{\text{KD}}\cdot LDL_{\text{baseline}}
\;+\;
Days_{\text{follow-up}}\cdot LDL_{\text{final}}
$$


> "Estimated lifelong LDL-C additionally included the product of age upon commencing a KD and pre-KD LDL-C."


$$
\text{Life-LDL-C}_{\text{exp}}
=
Days_{\text{KD}}\cdot LDL_{\text{baseline}}
\;+\;
Days_{\text{follow-up}}\cdot LDL_{\text{final}}
\;+\;
\boldsymbol{\big( Age_{\text{at-KD-start}}\cdot LDL_{\text{pre-KD}} \big)}
$$

::: {.fragment}

- **This equation is dimensionally inconsistent.**

:::
::: {.incremental}
- It adds days and age together. It's like adding miles and inches.
- pre-KD term is down-scaled by ~365× relative to the day-based terms.
- any associations with outcomes are dominated by keto diet exposure.
- if they did convert age, "lifetime" exposure just reflects how old someone was at KD

### This isn't an Age Mediation Analysis


![](assets/Age_mediation_bp.png){style="width:60%; height:auto !important;"}

::: {.smaller_caption}

> "Estimated lifetime LDL-C exposure was only a significant predictor of final NCPV in the univariable analysis but lost significance when age was included as a covariate (Table 3). Both age and lifetime LDL-C exposure lost significance when baseline CAC was included in the model (Table 3)."

:::

::: {.smaller_table}

::: {.fragment}

A [mediation](https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles/introduction-to-mediation-analysis) analysis is a specific statistical method that:

:::
::: {.incremental}

- tests how an exposure affects an outcome through a middle step (the *mediator*)
- estimates an indirect effect (through the mediator) and a direct effect (everything else).
- requires a pre-specified pathway and proper statistical testing (usually with CIs or bootstraps).

::: {.fragment}

**This is not a mediation analysis**.

:::
::: {.incremental}

- No indirect effect was estimated or tested. No causal model specified.
- Age can’t be a mediator of LDL exposure (age isn’t caused by LDL); it’s a confounder.
- They only compared p-values after adding variables.

:::
:::
:::

::: {.notes}


Exposure (E): lifetime LDL-C exposure
Mediator (M): baseline CAC (CAC_bl)
Outcome (Y): final NCPV
Confounder (A): age (affects E, M, and Y)

- The mediated/indirect path you’d test is: E → M → Y (LDL exposure → baseline CAC → final NCPV).
- When you include M = baseline CAC in the model, you block that E → M → Y path and estimate only the direct effect of E on Y (the E → Y arrow not going through M).

So “Adding baseline CAC blocks the pathway → tests only the direct effect” means: conditioning on baseline CAC removes the indirect route through CAC, leaving only the unmediated E → Y association to be estimated.


What mediation is (A → C through B):

Specify roles: Exposure (A), Mediator (B), Outcome (C).

Fit two models:

B ~ A (+ confounders) → path a

C ~ A + B (+ confounders) → paths b, c′

Report the indirect effect (a×b) with CIs (usually bootstrapped). State assumptions.

Only shows outcome regressions (NCPV_final ~ Age, then + Life-LDL-C_exp, then + CAC_bl).

No mediator model, no indirect effect, no CIs.

The "mediator" (Life-LDL-C_exp) is partly built from Age and mixes units → mathematical coupling; any drop in the Age coefficient can be mechanical.

### This isn't an Age Mediation Analysis


![](assets/Age_mediation_bp.png){style="width:60%; height:auto !important;"}

::: {.smaller_caption}

> "Estimated **lifetime LDL-C exposure** was only a **significant predictor of final NCPV** in the univariable analysis but lost significance when age was included as a covariate (Table 3). Both age and lifetime LDL-C exposure lost significance when baseline CAC was included in the model (Table 3)."

:::

::: {.smaller_table}

They ran (reported) three regressions with sequential covariate adjustment and concluded:

::: {.fragment}

*after adjusting for baseline CAC, neither age nor lifetime LDL-C predicts NCPV_final.*
:::
::: {.fragment}

*- **CAC explains the association**; age / lifetime LDL-exposure don’t matter.*

:::
::: {.fragment}

"Loses significance" ≠ mediation. Collinearity since lifetime LDL-C embeds age.

Age is a common cause/proxy of both lifetime LDL-C exposure and NCPV. It’s a confounder, not a mediator.

:::


::: {.fragment}

::: {.smaller_caption}
<br>
:::

Adding baseline CAC (a downstream variable) blocks the mediation pathway and biases effects.

<br> 

:::
::: {.fragment}

**They did NOT report `NCPV_final ~ lifetime LDL-C exposure`.**

:::
:::

::: {.notes}

MENTION THIS:

**lifetime LDL-C exposure was only a significant predictor of final NCPV in the univariable analysis**

they actually did a stepwise covariate adjustment on highly collinear variables and then over-interpreted p-value changes.

"loss of significance" doesn’t show that LDL or Age don’t matter; it shows the model is not set up to answer the mediation/mechanism question.


Intended pathway?: lifetime LDL-C → baseline CAC → NCPV_final.

Age affects all variables.


The “mediator” (Life-LDL-C_exp) is partly built from Age and mixes units → mathematical coupling; any drop in the Age coefficient can be mechanical.

Baseline CAC likely sits on the pathway from long-term LDL exposure to later plaque. Controlling for it can remove the very effect they're trying to test.

CAC association just shows baseline disease predicts future disease; they don’t establish that age or lifetime LDL exposure don’t matter

### Nonstandard Percent Change

> "The median change in NCPV was 18.9 mm3 (IQR: 9.3-47.0 mm³) and the median change in PAV was 0.8% (IQR: 0.3%-1.7%). Compared to baseline, these represent **a 43% and 50% change**, respectively."

Ratio-of-medians does not estimate a typical subject’s relative change; it can over/understate it.

*(note: $0.8$ is **percentage points**, not “%”)*

observations with baseline = 0 excluded from % change.”

IMPORTANT QUOTE:

"While it is true their **low-plaque baseline values magnify their percentual** changes and the observed absolute NCPV and PAV progression (18.9 mm3 and 0.8%, respectively)..."

They don't report "percentual" changes!

It is mathematically true that this can occur, but they didn’t compute per-person % change; the 43%/50% are ratios of medians and don’t capture that effect.

::: {.smaller2}

`ΔNCPV ~ ApoB_baseline` (unadjusted change score)

:::

::: {.smaller_table}

::: {.fragment}

**Question**: Among all participants, is baseline ApoB associated with the raw change in plaque over 1 year, without accounting for where people started or other factors?

:::
::: {.fragment}

**Slope interpretation**: Average difference in change (mm³) per 1 mg/dL higher ApoB, unadjusted.

:::
::: {.fragment}

**Clinically limited**: Doesn’t condition on starting plaque, age, sex, BP; easily distorted by baseline differences and extra noise in change scores.<br>

**Question**: Among people with the same starting plaque, age, sex, and BP, do those with higher ApoB tend to have more plaque in 1 year?

:::

:::

::: {.fragment}

::: {.smaller_caption}
<br>
:::

Optionally test ApoB × NCPV_baseline to allow baseline-dependent progression.

:::
:::


::: {.notes}

- Change scores are noisy: they compound measurement error from two scans, shrinking real effects.

- Baseline differences distort change: without conditioning on where people start, floor/ceiling and regression-to-the-mean effects can swamp signal.

- Observational confounding remains: unadjusted models can’t separate ApoB from other correlated risks or behaviors.

### The Norm: ANCOVA

::: {.smaller_table}

::: {.incremental}

- Adjusting for baseline with follow-up as outcome (ANCOVA) is considered the [preferred method](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1121605/)


- ["Whether the outcome is change score or post score, one should always adjust for baseline using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6330413/): follow-up as outcome, baseline as covariate

- [Adjusting](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8345531/) for [baseline and confounders](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7382001/) is [standard practice](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2796339/) in studies on [plaque progression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8374741/)

:::
::: {.incremental}

- Observational (pre–post) studies almost always include **baseline plaque** when modeling progression. Not doing so risks confounding and regression to the mean (baseline imbalance). 

- In RCTs randomization handles bias on average, but ANCOVA still gives cleaner, more precise estimates; it’s the usual choice.  

:::
::: {.incremental}

- Baseline adjustment with change scores (Δ)?
  - Better than not including it, ANCOVA still preferred
  - Compounds measurement error, noisier and more biased

::: {.smaller2}

- [The correlation between baseline score and post-intervention score, and its implications for statistical analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6330413/) — Change or post, **adjust for baseline** (ANCOVA) to avoid bias.  
- [Statistics notes: Analysing controlled trials with baseline and follow up measurements](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1121605/) — **ANCOVA** is the **preferred** general approach; more powerful/robust than Δ alone.  
- [Analyses of “change scores” do not estimate causal effects in observational data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9557845/) — Change scores do **not** estimate causal effects in observational settings.  


:::

:::
:::

::: {.notes}

Make ANCOVA primary; use Δ+Baseline as sensitivity. Annualize or adjust for scan interval; consider log/percent change for skew; report partial effects.


- **Baseline** often explains a [large share of variance](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8374741/) in follow-up, ie a high R². What does that mean for the R² of the other covariates?


:::

---


### Low R² = No Association!

::: {.smaller2}

::: {.fragment}

But consider the [Partial R²](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/138/)

:::
:::

::: {.smaller_table}

::: {.fragment}

`NCPV_follow-up ~ NCPV_baseline + ApoB`

:::
::: {.incremental}

- R² is the **fraction of total** variance explained by the **model** 

- **Baseline R²**: % of variation explained baseline-only model, very high due to test-retest reliability

- **Partial R²**: % of the **remaining** variation explained by another covariate(s) (e.g., ApoB)

:::
::: {.fragment}

If baseline explains a lot, a small R² can still be a large share of what’s explainable beyond baseline.

:::
::: {.fragment}

- **Clinical ≠ high R²**: small effects add up over time and can still push patients past treatment thresholds and risk classification

:::

::: {.fragment}




`NCPV_follow-up ~ NCPV_baseline + ApoB`

::: {.incremental}

- **Baseline R² ≈ 0.90:** 90% of follow-up NCPV variance is explained by **baseline NCPV**.
- **Residual R² after baseline: 10%**  (for risk factors + measurement error + noise)
- **ApoB effect:** ΔR² ≈ 0.03 ⇒ Partial R² (ApoB | baseline) = 0.03 / 0.10 = 0.30  
- ApoB explains 30% of the variance remaining after baseline.

:::
::: {.fragment}

A near-zero univariable slope (β≈0.07, R²=0.05) does not imply no association. Once baseline is accounted for, ApoB could explain a large fraction of the remaining variation. 

:::



:::
:::

::: {.notes}

In addition to all the other problems:

- nonlinearity
- change scores amplifying noise
- short follow up
- probably underpowered
- obvious ommitted variables

- Coefficients (slope) change because Baseline and ApoB share variance; adjusting for Baseline reveals ApoB’s unique contribution (β_ApoB≈+0.19 here).
- R² must increase when adding predictors; the key is how much of the **leftover explainable residual** variance is explained:  


- Could still simply mean the study was underpowered

:::

### Baseline Explains 96% of Variation

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {.smaller_table}


`NCPV_follow-up ~ NCPV_baseline`

univariable lm: **R² = 0.96**

GLS (REML) model: weighted **R² = 0.93**

::: {.incremental}

- Baseline almost perfectly predicts follow-up.
- ApoB or LDL is almost guaranteed to look null.
- The "signal" left for anything else to explain in NCPV_final is **~4%**.
- You’d need a huge ApoB effect, or much longer follow-up, more timepoints (), to detect anything.
- Univariable ApoB nulls are underpowered and non-informative.

"Plaque predicts plaque; ApoB does not" is a consequence of study design and model choice.

GLS: Generalized Least Squares (as opposed to Ordinary Least Squares)

REML = Restricted maximum likelihood

Most groups handle the ‘baseline dominates’ problem by (i) analyzing follow-up while explicitly adjusting for where each person started, (ii) also reporting a simple clinical endpoint like the share who regress vs progress, (iii) using size-neutral measures or transforms (e.g., PAV, √CAC) so results aren’t driven by starting size, (iv) comparing the same lesions across scans with models that account for multiple lesions per patient, and (v) standardizing scan protocols and, when possible, extending follow-up or adding a third scan so there’s real change left to detect.

### R² metrics are seldom shown here

::: {.smaller2}

**Total/adjusted/partial R²:** common in simple linear models; not standard for more advanced models

::: {.fragment}

There isn't one standard R² (beyond ordinary linear regression)

:::
::: {.incremental}

- **Model dependence & collinearity:** ApoB, LDL‐C, non‐HDL correlate → partial R² unstable.
- **Small samples:** partial R² can be very noisy
- **Mixed model families:** GLM/mixed/hurdle lack a single standard R² 
:::
::: {.incremental}

- **Plaque progression convention:** report $\beta$/OR with 95% CI and p-values.
- **Clinical interpretability:** "Δ outcome per 10 mg/dL ApoB" (not R²)
:::

::: {.fragment}

**Example:** Each 10 mg/dL higher ApoB is associated with a **+0.25 percentage-point** increase in plaque progression.

:::

::: {.fragment}

In this study, models violate OLS assumptions: R² can be high or low for the wrong reasons, misrepresenting model adequacy.

::: {.incremental}

1. Claims and charts contradict the data

2. Multiple conclusions lack supporting analyses/results

3. Some metrics are nonstandard or conceptually unsound

4. "Assumptions corroborated".   
  **— FALSE**. Model assumptions were violated.

5. Plaque doesn't predict (or beget) plaque. Baseline predicts follow-up.

6. ΔNCPV ∼ ApoB is the **weakest** plausible model choice

7. ANCOVA is the clinically relevant analysis

Follow-up NCPV was modeled as a linear function of baseline NCPV using generalized least squares (GLS): $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_i+\varepsilon_i$, with a power-of-the-mean residual variance $\operatorname{Var}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2\lvert\mu_i\rvert^{2\delta}$ (`nlme` `varPower`), where $\mu_i=\mathbb{E}[Y_i\mid X_i]$. 

Candidate variance structures (same fixed effects) were compared by likelihood-ratio tests under maximum likelihood.

The selected structure was refit by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) for parameter estimates and uncertainty. 

Pointwise 95% confidence bands for $\mathbb{E}[Y\mid X]$ were obtained from the model-based covariance of the fitted mean.

**Fit statistics (REML):** AIC = 874.15; BIC = 884.49; $\log L=-433.08$

**Variance function:** $\hat\delta=0.526$ (95% CI 0.357–0.695)

**Residual SD:** $2.097$ (df = 98; 95% CI 1.029–4.273)

| Term        | Estimate | 95% CI             | p-value |
|-------------|---------:|--------------------|:--------|
| Intercept   |   8.547  | 5.504 to 11.590    | <0.001  |
| Baseline NCPV | 1.304  | 1.231 to 1.378     | <0.001  |

*Robustness check (OLS with HC3 SEs):* $\hat\beta_1=1.251$ (SE 0.041), $p<0.001$, consistent with the GLS slope

Diagnostics were acceptable: on the normalized GLS scale residuals were approximately homoscedastic and centered, with only mild tail departures; inferences were robust to tail behavior (HC3-robust SEs and pairs bootstrap CIs).

R² (baseline → follow-up, with linear mean): Baseline alone explains ≈ 96% of the variation (GLS weighted "R²" ≈ 93%) in follow-up values. Only ~4% (or 7%) is left after accounting for baseline.

ICC = Intraclass Correlation Coefficient — Proportion of total variance due to differences between people (vs within-person change).

ICC ≈ 0.91: about 91% of variability is between individuals; within-person year-to-year change is small.

This is Autocorrelation, more specifically **serial (auto)correlation, or within-person persistence**, not insight. Baseline plaque "predicts" follow-up mainly because the measure is relatively stable over time (high R², high ICC).

If we use baseline-adjusted regression, we could answer the question: "What explains the extra change beyond baseline?" 

 baseline-adjusted model (ANCOVA):

`Follow-up ~ Baseline + ApoB (+ covariates)`

– Test ApoB’s incremental value (partial F-test / ΔR²)

– still need to check model assumptions

Effect modification check:

`Follow-up ~ Baseline + ApoB + (+ covariates) + Baseline*ApoB`

– If the interaction is non-significant, ApoB’s association with follow-up does not depend on baseline level.
