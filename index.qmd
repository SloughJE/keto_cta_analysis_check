## Linear Model Assumptions 


::: {.smaller}


4 Simple Linear Regression Assumptions

3 are tested with data (in this situation)

::: {.fragment}

- **Linearity**: between the predictor and the outcome

- **Constant variance** (homoscedasticity) of residuals

- **Normally distributed residuals** 

:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}

These linear assumptions are **quantifiable** and **objectively testable**.

:::
::: {.fragment}

- If the assumptions don’t hold, statistical significance and uncertainty estimates aren’t trustworthy
- Results may be invalid

:::
:::

::: {.notes}

- Linearity: on average, the relationship between the predictor and the outcome is a straight line

If the true pattern is curved, the slope summarizes the wrong thing and can misstate direction and size.

- Independence of errors (can be tested in some situations, not this one)

Dependence makes uncertainty estimates too small or too large.

- Constant variance (homoskedasticity)

If the spread grows or shrinks, standard errors and p-values from the basic model are mis-calibrated.

- Normally Distributed Residuals (errors) (mainly for small samples): error terms follow normal distribution.

The usual t-tests and confidence intervals rely on this; strong departures undermine those calculations.


- No exact collinearity (relevant in multivariable settings): predictors aren’t exact copies of each other.

Calling residual plot evaluation "subjective" is **misleading and evasive**.
Visual checks are interpretive, but these assumptions **objectively** testable with **quantifiable** methods.

Robust Linear Regression mainly down-weights outliers

It does not deal with non-linearity, heteroskedasticity and non-normality of residuals (directly, it can help sometimes...but)

### LM Assumptions: Objective Tests


::: {.smaller}


- Calling residual plot evaluation "subjective" is **misleading and evasive**.

::: {.fragment}

- Visual checks are interpretive, but these assumptions **objectively** testable with **quantifiable** methods.

- This is Statistics 101.


:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}

- "reran all models with robust linear regression...`MASS::rlm`"
:::
::: {.fragment}

- Robust Linear Regression mainly just down-weights outliers.

:::
::: {.fragment}

- Does not deal with non-linearity, heteroskedasticity and non-normality of residuals.

:::

:::

::: {.notes}

RLM can sometimes help a bit with non-normality but depends.

The two violations, non-normality and heteroskedasticity, are largely driven by the outcome’s distribution (ΔNCPV) and its mean–variance pattern. Swapping predictors (e.g., APOB vs CAC) usually won’t fix those. So it’s likely most univariable Δ models would show the same two problems.

### Missing TPS Models and Results

::: {.smaller_table}

> "**Results** Neither change in ApoB ..., baseline ApoB, nor total LDL-C exposure ... were associated with the change in noncalcified plaque volume (NCPV) or TPS."

> "Neither … change in ApoB nor the ApoB level ... were associated ... with **TPS** (Figures 2D and 2E, **Table 3**)." - "changes in and baseline levels of ApoB were not associated with changes in NCPV or TPS"

<br>

:::

::: {.smaller2}

Figures 2D–2F are Δ-TPS (outcome) panels (vs ΔApoB, ApoB, CAC_bl)

No Δ-TPS ~ LDL-C, LDL-C exposure, or ApoB model results anywhere.

### Bayes Factor `rscale` is not Moderate

::: {.smaller_table}
::: {.fragment}

> "Bayes factors were calculated...with...an ~ `rscale value of 0.8` to contrast a **moderately informative** prior with a conservative distribution width (to allow for potential large effect sizes) due to the well-documented association between ApoB changes and coronary plaque changes."
:::
:::

::: {.smaller2}

::: {.fragment}

Calling rscale = 0.8 "moderately informative" is inaccurate.

:::
::: {.fragment}

[R package docs](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/BayesFactor/html/regressionBF.html): **"medium", "wide", "ultrawide" = 0.354, 0.5, 0.707**  

:::
::: {.fragment}

- `rscaleCont = 0.8` is **wider than “ultrawide”** → a **very diffuse** prior that places substantial mass on **very large** effects  

:::
::: {.fragment}

- Same r-scale apparently used for **all models**, no justification.
- No reported **prior-sensitivity** to alternative r-scales  

:::
:::

::: {.smaller_table}
::: {.fragment}

**Fixed description**:
:::

::: {.fragment}

"We used a very wide prior on coefficients (`rscale = 0.8`) wider than the package’s ultrawide, which places substantial prior mass on very large effects. This diffuse prior penalizes small-to-moderate effects, requiring much stronger evidence than under the ‘wide’ or ‘medium’ defaults."

### LDL-C Exposure Calculation

::: {.smaller_table}

> "LDL-C exposure on a KD was calculated by summing the products of the reported days on a KD prior to study commencement and baseline LDL-C on a KD plus the study follow-up days by their final LDL-C."



$$
\text{LDL-C}_{\text{exp}}
=
Days_{\text{KD}}\cdot LDL_{\text{baseline}}
\;+\;
Days_{\text{follow-up}}\cdot LDL_{\text{final}}
$$

<br>

:::
::: {.smaller2}

::: {.fragment}

- one baseline value for all pre-study Keto Diet time and one final value for all follow-up is a coarse simplification
- relies on recall of KD start
:::
::: {.fragment}
- standard AUC/time-weighted approach (need multiple measurements)
- limitation due to resources

:::
:::

### Lifetime LDL-C Formula Doesn’t Add Up

::: {.smaller_table}

> "LDL-C exposure on a KD was calculated by summing the products of the reported days on a KD prior to study commencement and baseline LDL-C on a KD plus the study follow-up days by their final LDL-C."



$$
\text{LDL-C}_{\text{exp}}
=
Days_{\text{KD}}\cdot LDL_{\text{baseline}}
\;+\;
Days_{\text{follow-up}}\cdot LDL_{\text{final}}
$$


> "Estimated lifelong LDL-C additionally included the product of age upon commencing a KD and pre-KD LDL-C."


$$
\text{Life-LDL-C}_{\text{exp}}
=
Days_{\text{KD}}\cdot LDL_{\text{baseline}}
\;+\;
Days_{\text{follow-up}}\cdot LDL_{\text{final}}
\;+\;
\boldsymbol{\big( Age_{\text{at-KD-start}}\cdot LDL_{\text{pre-KD}} \big)}
$$

::: {.fragment}

- **This equation is dimensionally inconsistent.**

:::
::: {.fragment}
- It adds days and age together. It's like adding miles and inches.
- pre-KD term is down-scaled by ~365× relative to the day-based terms.
- any associations with outcomes are dominated by keto diet exposure.
- if they did convert age, "lifetime" exposure just reflects how old someone was at KD

### This isn't an Age Mediation Analysis


![](assets/Age_mediation_bp.png){style="width:60%; height:auto !important;"}

::: {.smaller_caption}

> "Estimated lifetime LDL-C exposure was only a significant predictor of final NCPV in the univariable analysis but lost significance when age was included as a covariate (Table 3). Both age and lifetime LDL-C exposure lost significance when baseline CAC was included in the model (Table 3)."

:::

::: {.smaller_table}

::: {.fragment}

A [mediation](https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles/introduction-to-mediation-analysis) analysis is a specific statistical method that:


- tests how an exposure affects an outcome through a middle step (the *mediator*)
- estimates an indirect effect (through the mediator) and a direct effect (everything else).
- requires a pre-specified pathway and proper statistical testing (usually with CIs or bootstraps).

::: {.fragment}

**This is not a mediation analysis**.

- No indirect effect was estimated or tested. No causal model specified.
- Age can’t be a mediator of LDL exposure (age isn’t caused by LDL); it’s a confounder.
- They only compared p-values after adding variables.

:::
:::
:::

::: {.notes}


Exposure (E): lifetime LDL-C exposure
Mediator (M): baseline CAC (CAC_bl)
Outcome (Y): final NCPV
Confounder (A): age (affects E, M, and Y)

- The mediated/indirect path you’d test is: E → M → Y (LDL exposure → baseline CAC → final NCPV).
- When you include M = baseline CAC in the model, you block that E → M → Y path and estimate only the direct effect of E on Y (the E → Y arrow not going through M).

So “Adding baseline CAC blocks the pathway → tests only the direct effect” means: conditioning on baseline CAC removes the indirect route through CAC, leaving only the unmediated E → Y association to be estimated.


What mediation is (A → C through B):

Specify roles: Exposure (A), Mediator (B), Outcome (C).

Fit two models:

B ~ A (+ confounders) → path a

C ~ A + B (+ confounders) → paths b, c′

Report the indirect effect (a×b) with CIs (usually bootstrapped). State assumptions.

Only shows outcome regressions (NCPV_final ~ Age, then + Life-LDL-C_exp, then + CAC_bl).

No mediator model, no indirect effect, no CIs.

The "mediator" (Life-LDL-C_exp) is partly built from Age and mixes units → mathematical coupling; any drop in the Age coefficient can be mechanical.


:::

### Age in Exposure, then Control for Age


![](assets/Age_mediation_bp.png){style="width:60%; height:auto !important;"}

::: {.smaller_caption}

> "Estimated lifetime LDL-C exposure was only a significant predictor of final NCPV in the univariable analysis but lost significance when age was included as a covariate (Table 3). Both age and lifetime LDL-C exposure lost significance when baseline CAC was included in the model (Table 3)."

:::

::: {.smaller_table}

They ran (reported) three regressions with sequential covariate adjustment and concluded:

::: {.fragment}

*after adjusting for baseline CAC, neither age nor lifetime LDL-C predicts NCPV_final.*
:::
::: {.fragment}

*- **CAC explains the association**; age / lifetime LDL-exposure don’t matter.*

:::
::: {.fragment}

"Loses significance" ≠ mediation. Collinearity since lifetime LDL-C embeds age.

Age is a common cause/proxy of both lifetime LDL-C exposure and NCPV. It’s a confounder, not a mediator.

:::


::: {.fragment}

::: {.smaller_caption}
<br>
:::

Adding baseline CAC (a downstream variable) blocks the mediation pathway and biases effects.

<br> 

:::
::: {.fragment}

**They did NOT report `NCPV_final ~ lifetime LDL-C exposure`.**

:::
:::

::: {.notes}

MENTION THIS:

**lifetime LDL-C exposure was only a significant predictor of final NCPV in the univariable analysis**

they actually did a stepwise covariate adjustment on highly collinear variables and then over-interpreted p-value changes.

"loss of significance" doesn’t show that LDL or Age don’t matter; it shows the model is not set up to answer the mediation/mechanism question.


Intended pathway?: lifetime LDL-C → baseline CAC → NCPV_final.

Age affects all variables.


The “mediator” (Life-LDL-C_exp) is partly built from Age and mixes units → mathematical coupling; any drop in the Age coefficient can be mechanical.

Baseline CAC likely sits on the pathway from long-term LDL exposure to later plaque. Controlling for it can remove the very effect they're trying to test.

CAC association just shows baseline disease predicts future disease; they don’t establish that age or lifetime LDL exposure don’t matter

### Nonstandard Percent Change

::: {.smaller_table}

> "The median change in NCPV was 18.9 mm3 (IQR: 9.3-47.0 mm³) and the median change in PAV was 0.8% (IQR: 0.3%-1.7%). Compared to baseline, these represent **a 43% and 50% change**, respectively."

::: {.fragment}


**Standard percent change:**   $\operatorname{median}\!\left(\frac{NCPV_{1y}-NCPV_{bl}}{NCPV_{bl}}\right)\times 100\%$


"What was the typical relative change per subject?"

:::

::: {.smaller2}
<br>
:::


::: {.fragment}

They computed a **ratio of median change to baseline median:** $\frac{\operatorname{median}(NCPV_{1y}-NCPV_{bl})}{\operatorname{median}(NCPV_{bl})}\times 100\%$
  

:::
::: {.fragment}


- NCPV: $18.9/44 \approx 43\%$; and PAV: $0.8/1.6 \approx 50\%$

Their "percent change" metric is nonstandard and should be labeled and justified.

:::

::: {.notes}

Ratio-of-medians does not estimate a typical subject’s relative change; it can over/understate it.

*(note: $0.8$ is **percentage points**, not “%”)*

observations with baseline = 0 excluded from % change.”

IMPORTANT QUOTE:

"While it is true their **low-plaque baseline values magnify their percentual** changes and the observed absolute NCPV and PAV progression (18.9 mm3 and 0.8%, respectively)..."

They don't report "percentual" changes!

It is mathematically true that this can occur, but they didn’t compute per-person % change; the 43%/50% are ratios of medians and don’t capture that effect.

### Univariable Change Models Can Mislead

::: {.smaller_table}

- Basic confounding unchecked (age, sex, BP)

- Δ results in less power, compounded noise

:::
::: {.fragment}

**Clinically limited**: Doesn’t condition on starting plaque, age, sex, BP; easily distorted by baseline differences and extra noise in change scores.<br>

:::

::: {.fragment}

::: {.smaller_caption}
<br>
:::

Optionally test ApoB × NCPV_baseline to allow baseline-dependent progression.

:::
:::


::: {.notes}

- Change scores are noisy: they compound measurement error from two scans, shrinking real effects.

- Baseline differences distort change: without conditioning on where people start, floor/ceiling and regression-to-the-mean effects can swamp signal.

- Observational confounding remains: unadjusted models can’t separate ApoB from other correlated risks or behaviors.

Follow-up NCPV was modeled as a linear function of baseline NCPV using generalized least squares (GLS): $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_i+\varepsilon_i$, with a power-of-the-mean residual variance $\operatorname{Var}(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2\lvert\mu_i\rvert^{2\delta}$ (`nlme` `varPower`), where $\mu_i=\mathbb{E}[Y_i\mid X_i]$. 

Candidate variance structures (same fixed effects) were compared by likelihood-ratio tests under maximum likelihood.

The selected structure was refit by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) for parameter estimates and uncertainty. 

Pointwise 95% confidence bands for $\mathbb{E}[Y\mid X]$ were obtained from the model-based covariance of the fitted mean.

**Fit statistics (REML):** AIC = 874.15; BIC = 884.49; $\log L=-433.08$

**Variance function:** $\hat\delta=0.526$ (95% CI 0.357–0.695)

**Residual SD:** $2.097$ (df = 98; 95% CI 1.029–4.273)

| Term        | Estimate | 95% CI             | p-value |
|-------------|---------:|--------------------|:--------|
| Intercept   |   8.547  | 5.504 to 11.590    | <0.001  |
| Baseline NCPV | 1.304  | 1.231 to 1.378     | <0.001  |

*Robustness check (OLS with HC3 SEs):* $\hat\beta_1=1.251$ (SE 0.041), $p<0.001$, consistent with the GLS slope

Diagnostics were acceptable: on the normalized GLS scale residuals were approximately homoscedastic and centered, with only mild tail departures; inferences were robust to tail behavior (HC3-robust SEs and pairs bootstrap CIs).

R² (baseline → follow-up, with linear mean): Baseline alone explains ≈ 96% of the variation (GLS weighted "R²" ≈ 93%) in follow-up values. Only ~4% (or 7%) is left after accounting for baseline.

ICC = Intraclass Correlation Coefficient — Proportion of total variance due to differences between people (vs within-person change).

ICC ≈ 0.91: about 91% of variability is between individuals; within-person year-to-year change is small.

This is Autocorrelation, more specifically **test–retest reliability**, not insight. Baseline plaque "predicts" follow-up mainly because the measure is relatively stable over time (high R², high ICC).

If we use baseline-adjusted regression, we could answer the question: "What explains the extra change beyond baseline?" 

 baseline-adjusted model (ANCOVA):

`Follow-up ~ Baseline + ApoB (+ covariates)`

– Test ApoB’s incremental value (partial F-test / ΔR²)

– still need to check model assumptions

Effect modification check:

`Follow-up ~ Baseline + ApoB + (+ covariates) + Baseline*ApoB`

– If the interaction is non-significant, ApoB’s association with follow-up does not depend on baseline level.
